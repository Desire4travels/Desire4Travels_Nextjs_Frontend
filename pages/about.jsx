            <strong>Desire4Travels</strong> is more than just a travel company — it’s a community built by travelers, for travelers. Founded in 2016 by <strong>Ayush Agrawal</strong>, a passionate explorer with an entrepreneurial spirit, Desire4Travels began with a simple goal: to help people experience the joy of meaningful, well-planned travel without the stress and overpricing often associated with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a personal mission to organize smooth and budget-friendly trips for friends and peers quickly evolved into a trusted brand that today serves hundreds of travelers across PAN India.

          <h2 className="about-subtitle">Our Journey</h2>
          <p>
            We’ve curated hundreds of tours across India — from the snow-capped mountains of Spiti, Manali, and Ladakh to the tranquil beaches of Goa and Kerala, the cultural richness of Rajasthan and Varanasi, and the unexplored beauty of the North East and Andaman Islands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a solo traveler seeking peace in the hills, a group chasing adventure, a couple planning a romantic escape, or a family looking for a relaxed holiday — we tailor experiences to match your vision, budget, and interests.
